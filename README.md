## Abstract

For this project, I plan on using creative materials from my childhood as generation points for visuals. This would look like taking drawings Ive done as a kid and uploading to "find" them in the GAN. This would also include taking writing my younger self has done and using it as a text prompt for illustrations. This all would serve a purpose of going back to a simpler time in my creative journey and extending it to my current practice as a sort of time travel. 

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- move files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
