# Garfield takes on machine learning

## Abstract

For this project, I originally planned on using creative materials from my childhood as 
generation points for visuals. However, the image to image translation options available was not creating the visuals I wanted. In my journey of going through drawings, I found many drawings of Garfield, a childhood muse of mine, and switched my topic. 

The new concept for the project would involve taking strips of Garfield comics and describing each panel in text format to prompt image generation. I then compiled all of the panels together to create one "cohesive" strip that told the original story. For some panels, I prompted twice. One with the image description, and one with the text spoken by the character. 


## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- move files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
