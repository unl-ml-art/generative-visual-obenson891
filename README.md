# Garfield takes on machine learning

## Abstract

For this project, I originally planned on using creative materials from my childhood as 
generation points for visuals. However, the image to image translation options available was not creating the visuals I wanted. In my journey of going through drawings, I found many drawings of Garfield, a childhood muse of mine, and switched my topic. 

The new concept for the project would involve taking strips of Garfield comics and describing each panel in text format to prompt image generation. I then compiled all of the panels together to create one "cohesive" strip that told the original story. For some panels, I prompted twice. One with the image description, and one with the text spoken by the character. 


## Model/Data

Files that are included:
  - Final Booklet
      - Edited compilations of images
  - Raw Generated Images
      - Images output by the website from the text input, pre-editing
      - Titles of images denote the input used to create the image

## Code

Website used to generate images:  
https://hotpot.ai/art-maker 
AI Art Maker: turn text to art - Hotpot.ai 

## Results

Final compilation of three Garfield comic strips

## Technical Notes

To create the images on https://hotpot.ai/art-maker I utilized the "custom" style, and prompted the text with my own style descriptors such as "comic text" and "comic panel" to acheive the style of a comic and not the realism produced with the other styles.
